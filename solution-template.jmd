# Problem 1 

## Problem 1.1
```julia
function square_number(x)
  output = x^2 
  return output
end

```
## Problem 1.2 - NEED HELP
```julia
using printf
printf("We can see that 5Ë†2 = %0.20f", square_number(5))
```

## Problem 1.3
```julia
squares = zeros(21,1)
for i in -10:10
  squares[i+11] = square_number(i)
end

using Plots
x = -10:10
plot(x, squares, label="Squares", xlabel="Integers", ylabel="Integer Squares")
```

aold = x
anew = 1
tol = 1e-6;
while abs(aold-anew) > tol
  aold = anew
